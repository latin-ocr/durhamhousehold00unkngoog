most minute details of his own proceedings as Bursar

duly transferred to his great annual account roll—but

their substance only. In the roll he contents himself

respective heads; but here in his book we have daily
memoranda under every department within his care,
with the most minute specification of names-and priceS‚
together with numerous other entries to aid his me-

to much voluntary and valuable information of this
nature, the fly-leaves at the beginning and end of
each year abound with the most curious entrieS‚ which
the Bursar intended for no eye save his own ; but these
entries do not constitute the chief value of his book.
We have here every article of food and clothing, the
whole consumption in short of the great monastery of
Durham for four yearS‚ most minutely detailed. Men

luxurieS‚ are all set forth to the inquisitive reader by a
