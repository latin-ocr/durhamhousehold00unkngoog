Lum Pmoms, 9, 13, 810. At four pe-
riods of the year, at the Feast of the
Purification, at Easter‚ on the day of
St. John the nuptm, and on the day of
Au Ssinoe, the Prior withdrew from
Durham ιο 000 of his Manor houses,
01ιοοἁοᾱ by his officere and a consider-
able number of the fraternity, for the
purposes οἱ feasting and relaxation.
The places to which he retired in their
turns were generally Bearpark, Byew-
ley, Pittington‚ and Wardley, but Mug-
gleswick and other places were perhaps
occasionally visited, and, in some in-
stances, aster the ordinary Ludus had
been brought ιο a termination, special
Ludi were held, which, as in the case at
Byewley, in 1538, hereafter mentioned,
lasted for three days in succession. Π
any opinion can be formed from the
consumption of provisions 00 ι11000
occasions, the people of the neigh-
bourhood seem to have attended in
great numbers, and in all probability
one of the amusements which they
were permitted ιο witness was an exhi-
bition of mii-acle plays or myster-ies.
The word Ludus seems ιο justify this
inserence. The ordinary allowance of
provisions for these gemes made by the
Bursar in each year is detailed in ι110
pagos above referred to, but the later
books afford much additional informa-
tion. In 1538, ι110 Imdm of All Saints
was held at Beaurepaire, and that ‚of
St. John the Baptist preceding at
Byewley. of the expenditure and

- consumption of food at this latter place,
we have the following minute account.
It will be obser-ved that the ordinary
Ludus is first mentioned.
